## Moving Machine Learning to the Web
### a Simple Linear Regression model for predicting the Popular Bike Rentals
- The back end runs Flask.
- The project is modeled using Python in the notebook. We simplify the model the web application by including 4 features
  - Season
  - Temperature
  - Day
  - Hour
 - Improvements can be done by increasing the number of features and creating polynormials as shown in the notebook.
 - The web application is easy to add these improvements
